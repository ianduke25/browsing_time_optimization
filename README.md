# Netflix UI Optimization Study

## Overview
This repository contains a Jupyter notebook, `Netflix_UI_Optimization.ipynb`, focused on optimizing the user interface (UI) of a simulated Netflix platform. The notebook employs a multifactorial experimental design and response surface methodology to analyze various UI elements' effects on user engagement and satisfaction. It is important to note that the data used in this study is simulated and does not represent real Netflix user data. The purpose of this simulation is to demonstrate the application of experimental design principles and response surface methodology in a controlled setting.

## Objective
The primary objective of this study is to explore the impact of different UI elements on user interaction metrics using simulated data. Through a series of factorial experiments and optimization techniques, we aim to identify key factors that enhance user experience and provide recommendations for UI improvements.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter or JupyterLab
- Basic understanding of Python programming
- Familiarity with experimental design and statistical analysis concepts

## Installation
1. Ensure Python 3.x is installed on your system.
2. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
3. Install the necessary Python packages:

```bash
pip install numpy scipy pandas matplotlib statsmodels jupyterlab
```

## Content Description
- **Part 1-6**: Detailed walkthroughs of each experimental phase, including gatekeeper tests, factor screening, factorial experiments, and response surface analysis.
- **Visualizations**: Clustering visualizations and interaction effects to aid in the interpretation of results.
- **Time Complexity Experiments**: Analysis of the algorithm's performance across different conditions.

## Written Report
Included in the repository is a comprehensive written report summarizing the experiment results and providing GUI recommendations based on the findings. This report is essential for understanding the study's conclusions and the rationale behind the suggested UI enhancements.

## Running the Notebook
1. Navigate to the notebook's directory.
2. Launch JupyterLab or Jupyter Notebook:

```bash
jupyter lab
```
or
```bash
jupyter notebook
```

3. Open `Netflix_UI_Optimization.ipynb` from the Jupyter interface.

## Note on Data
The data used in this study is entirely simulated, created to demonstrate the principles of multifactorial experimental design and response surface methodology in a UI optimization context. It is not derived from real Netflix user data.
